# Covid 19 Statics

**Version 1.00**

Code and document for the Covid 19 Statics.

This is project that made in appleSeeds bootCamp.

\*\* How I Build The Project

- I use FETCH to get the covid-19 API.
- And to get country by continent API.

- I use ASYNCH FUNCTIONS to handle the data and
- to build the array's that i need for sort and render
- the data from the API to the html.

- I use CHART.JS to bulid the graf and connect the data
- to the graf.

- I build a sort functions to give result by user preference
- and make the option to choise between result by country or
- by continent.

- I use Object Destructuring to get the data from the API
- to get access easily to the field i need.

\*\* What Languege I Use

- I made it with HTML CSS AND JAVA-SCRIPT.
- I use a lot of method and separte the code
- to different files.

- FETCH
- ASYNCH FUNCTIONS
- CHART.JS
- API
- OBJECT DESTTUCTURING
